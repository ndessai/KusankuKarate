                                        Peter and Matthew LaBarca received their Shodan (1st degree black belt) in October 2014 after more than five years of karate study.  Karate needs to become another part of your life, like training, education, career and building up skill sets.  Family and Faith of course remain the center of life.  You need to train every day to whatever capability you can.

                                        The guiding principles also teach that progression is slow and determined.  Currently Peter works as an embedded software engineer and Matthew is a student.

                                            Japan is made up of a series of island.  The lower west portions of the islands are called the Ryukyu islands including Okinawa.  The karate that is practiced there was taught to Seiyu Oyata through his father.  During world war two he learned a number of forms of karate including judo, kendo, and chinese martial arts.  
                                            <br><br>
                                            Most martial arts were practiced in public but Seiyu learned from Uhugushiku and Wakinaguri who taught him arts passed down from generation to generation and kept hidden.  Later on Seiyu studied under Shigeru Nakamura founder of Kenpo and learned the basic twelve empty hand katas.  He came to America to teach his arts in 1977 and taught Albert Geraldi, Jim Logue, Bill Wiswell and Greg Lindquest.  eiyu Oyata's karate iscalled Ryu-te which means flowing hand (like the islands).
